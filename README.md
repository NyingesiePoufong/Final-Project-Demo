# Template for my final project


### Goal: 

-- In progress

The purpose of this is to make a dashboard for teachers or managers to see the overall progress of their students or teams(SLA) as a whole. It will also allow the admin to see individual or team progress on their profiles. I hope to add a page that allows parents to see reports or when a teacher request a meeting. There will be a feature that supports emotional and mental health as well as safety.
